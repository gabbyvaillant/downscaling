# **Climate Downscaling**

Repository for code created for my climate downscaling research.
GOAL of research project: Preform machine learning-based climate downscaling on our desired climate datasets.

Small scale goal as of 07/17: Input weather .csv file into TimeGAN model (using ydata-synthetic) and evaluate accuracy

**Code Explanation**

(1) weather-to-GAN.ipynb
* Following tutorial used in [ydata-synthetic repository](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/blob/dev/examples/timeseries/TimeGAN_Synthetic_stock_data.ipynb)
* Trying to input a simple weather data file (.csv format) into the TimeGAN model using ydata-synthetic library
