# **Climate Downscaling** üåßÔ∏è

## Introduction
This repository contains code developed for climate downscaling research using machine learning techniques. The objective is to utilize the TimeGAN model for downscaling selected climate datasets (GCMs in netCDF file format). The project initially focuses on generating synthetic weather data and aims to implement climate downscaling methodologies within the TimeGAN framework.

## Code Explanation

(0) data-manip directory

(a) netCDF_to_timeseries.ipynb
* Converted temperature netCDF file to .csv file for only ONE grid location
* Followed [Youtube tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hrm5RmsVXo0)
  
(1) weather-to-GAN.ipynb
* Trying to input a simple weather data file (.csv format) into the TimeGAN model using ydata-synthetic library
* Following tutorial used in [ydata-synthetic repository](https://github.com/ydataai/ydata-synthetic/blob/dev/examples/timeseries/TimeGAN_Synthetic_stock_data.ipynb)

(2) data_loading.py

* Normalizer function used to preprocess data
* Transform climate data in netCDF format to preprocessed data (normalized and split into squences)

(3) data directory

(a) domnys-nam_218_20191011_0000_0000.nc
* Example of one NetCDF file that contains our three variables of interest to be downscaled

  ## Info:
  * Variables of interest:
    - TMP_1000mb (Temperature at surface level)
    - RH_1000mb (Relative Humidity at surface level)
    - VVEL_1000mb (Pressure at surface level)
